# yolov3-ult 

This repo is forked from [ultralytics/yolov3](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3).
See original repo for complete doc.

However, I have changed train.py quite a bit.
For usage info, type ```python3 train.py -h```.

Also see transfer_cfg/* for the transfer learning scenario,
and see from0_cfg/* for the "train from scratch" scenario.
Each tries to train yolov3 to recognize 17 classes of objects.
The resulting mAP is below 0.2 :-(
